    Infinity-Forum (IF) is a Not For Profit Organization, formally a sole proprietorship,

    but like all users may be rewarded through the built-in reputation system. IF distributes all of its profits to its users based on reputation to stimulate productivity on the website.

    IF utilizes an open-source algorithm in order to manage its budget and distribute rewards to users based on merit.
    These algorithms are subject to change; IF is not responsible for compensating users for any donations/investments or activity on the website infinity-forum.org.
    IF is also not responsible for any lost work. IF reserves the right to remove or censor any content for any reason. Pornographic material is not allowed on the site.

<p>
    IF modules maintain a source list and reward system that allows users to utilize the works of others in their own contributions while keeping track of merit. 
    All users own their own work. By using IF, you are authorizing IF and other users to utilize your work on the system as long as they use the built in channels for maintaining credit. To use your work outside of the system, they must gain permission from all contributors and/or follow any additional license stated for the work, unless the purpose is not-for-profit or solely to add revenue to Infinity-Forum, in which case they are able to use any passages (you authorize this usage by continuing to use this site). The full list of contributors must be included with the work.
