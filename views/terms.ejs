<p>
    IF utilizes an open-source algorithm in order to manage its budget and distribute rewards to users based on merit.
    These algorithms are subject to change; IF is not responsible for compensating users for any donations or activity on the website infinity-forum.org.
    IF is also not responsible for any lost work. IF reserves the right to remove or censor any content for any reason. Pornographic or illegal material is not allowed on the site. Distributing pornographic material on this site or choosing a profile name or information that is pornographic in nature may result in your account being removed or suspended.
</p>

<p>
    IF modules maintain a source list and reward system that allows users to utilize the works of others in their own contributions while keeping track of merit. 
    All users own their own work. By using IF, you are authorizing IF and other users to utilize your work on the system as long as they use the built in channels for maintaining credit. To use your work outside of the system (creating a derivative work, making a profit, etc., excluding standard sharing practices (fair use)), non co-owners must gain permission from all contributors, unless the purpose is not-for-profit and open source (with a CC-BY-NC license), or solely to add revenue to Infinity-Forum, in which case they are able to use any passages (you authorize this usage by continuing to use this site). The full list of contributors must be included with the work. Infinity-Forum is considered a contributor to any projects with a source, but our permission is automatically given for external works. 

    Co-owners (those cited in a novel work) to any intellectual property are allowed to use it outside of the system so long as they allocate an equal portion of the net income for each contributor.
