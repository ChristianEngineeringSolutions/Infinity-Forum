    CES modules maintain a source list and reward system that allows users to utilize the works of others in their own contributions while keeping track of merit.
    By using CES, you are authorizing CES and other users to utilize your work on the system so long as they use the built in channels for maintaining credit.
    You are also agreeing not to utilize the work of others without utilizing the built-in-citation system UNLESS otherwise stated in the sub-license for the work in question. If the origin of the cited work is off-site,
    you may perform a normal citation (mentioning the author and original work).
