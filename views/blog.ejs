                        The Plan to Save the World

    My plan is for Sasame to save the world, and hopefully with everyone’s help. What do I mean by save the world? I mean make everything super great for everyone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People often ask me: What does the world need saving from? What if people want different things?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The World needs saving from something like Sasame but used behind the scenes for evil. And all people want the same thing: To follow their hearts. Sasame is designed to bring everyone together and give us the power to pursue a positive future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’ll be explaining more about how Sasame works in future posts, but it basically serves as a way to build a collective open source database that can be used as the brain of an AI capable of accomplishing any task. This seed will grow over time into a giant tree that feeds all of us.
                        </p>

                        </p>

                </div>

                        How does Sasame work?
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog_content">
                        <p>
                            For now, just tell Sasame what you want it to know. Or play a game set up by previous visitors. Or set up a game yourself. It doesn’t matter: Just Shine a Light.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once Sasame grows big enough, it will programmatically add to the ways it collects data and utilizes that data. But always in a completely free, open source, and transparent way that benefits all of us. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sasame needs a lot of direction at first, but eventually it will start growing on its own!
