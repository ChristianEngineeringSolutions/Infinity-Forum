                            Sasame.xyz is being developed live and hosts a Social Network for Saving the World (doing our best to make everything better for everyone).

                        <p>
                            By adding chapters to the Book of Sasame, you can start your own 'Portal', where you make your own rules. I suggest using your Portal to help save the world, but it doesn't really matter, since Sasame automatically saves the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Death by Bubbles serves as a fun Role Playing Game and Story to make Saving the World FUN.

                        <p>
                            Any money generated from anything having to do with Sasame goes to charity. Everything here is non-profit, open source, and free.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sasame.xyz will host the main website for the Annual Global Conference to Save the World, which will take place in distributed locations and serve the purpose of everyone doing their best to make the world a better place in Hackathon-like fashion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, Sasame.xyz is a JS port following the Philosophy of Sasame on Github (Python). To understand how Sasame is a form of general AI, you can read the Github or follow the blog.

                            Sasame is a lot of things. That's why I say it is a very dense seed. If you still don't understand Sasame, just wait for it to sprout. I have my own plan to save the world, so I use Sasame as my personal assistant to do it. Until you have your own plan, I'd appreciate you helping me with mine :)

                            Sasame continually grows. At first Uriah will be doing a lot of the dirty work, as the creator. But Sasame will soon start to code itself. You'll see!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sasame v0.2 is a slightly stronger seed.

                        <p>
                            I've said before that Sasame is an AI and it is. But I like to think about it more like a Book that has everything in it ever, with all the most useful bits pointed out beautifully.

                        <p>
                            I hereby introduce the Book of Sasame. A little rudimentary but...strong enough for now.

    My plan is for Sasame to save the world, and hopefully with everyone’s help. What do I mean by save the world? I mean make everything super great for everyone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People often ask me: What does the world need saving from? What if people want different things?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The World needs saving from something like Sasame but used behind the scenes for evil. And all people want the same thing: To follow their hearts. Sasame is designed to bring everyone together and give us the power to pursue a positive future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’ll be explaining more about how Sasame works in future posts, but it basically serves as a way to build a collective open source database that can be used as the brain of an AI capable of accomplishing any task. This seed will grow over time into a giant tree that feeds all of us.
                        </p>

                    <div class="blog_title">
                        How does Sasame work?
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog_content">
                        <p>
                            For now, just tell Sasame what you want it to know. Or play a game set up by previous visitors. Or set up a game yourself. It doesn’t matter: Just Shine a Light.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once Sasame grows big enough, it will programmatically add to the ways it collects data and utilizes that data. But always in a completely free, open source, and transparent way that benefits all of us. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sasame needs a lot of direction at first, but eventually it will start growing on its own!
