Normal chapter url displays passages in chapter as normal passages (unexecutable). Only admin-verified passages/chapters can be made live outside of sandbox
but not a writeable version.
Within chapter we will also display a sandbox where they can see the result of their code. Basically, aggregate passage content and run as html. They will need
to write script tags in order to execute javascript.
So, every chapter has an iframe portal to /chapter/id/sandbox
