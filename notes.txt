okay so when a starrer stars a passage, 
the author of that passage now owes the starrer a debt
So we need to get all the debt they owe, before they can star that starrer back

when a starrer stars a passage,
the author of that passage also inherits all the starrers debt.

you can pay off the debt owed for each transaction before adding new debt 


/forum posts feed personal in passage routes

Almost!
get remote page should go in the systemController (new)
sharePassage, updatePassage, afterPassageCreation, handlePassageLink, getBigPassage, getRecursiveSpecials, labelOptions, can go in the passageController
bookmarkPassage is already in the bookmarkController
starPassage is already in the starController
uploadFile is already in the fileController
updateFile, getDirectoryStructure, decodeDirectoryStructure can go in the fileController
copyPassage is already in the passageController
The star_passage route is already in routes/stars.js

You cut out a lot of logic from getAdminDashboard (you got rid of my aggregate query, for example), uploadtogcs needs the full implementation, 



Good but syncFileStream should go in adminService.js. You can call updateFile from services/fileService.js (its not there yet but i will add it). GetPassage is in passageService.js. You dont need to export the adminService functions in adminController. You can use const redisClient = getRedisClient();
    const redis = getRedisOps(); from config/redis.js for handling the redis stuff.
