# The Plan to Save the World

## 1. Sasame, A Social Network for Problem Solving.
(Under Development)

All content is modular (whether it be text, image, audio, video, code, etc.)
Users on the site stitch modules together to create new modules.
These modules might be projects, books, games, songs, policies, apps, hardware schematics, etc.
Modules keep a record of contributors and can be plugged and played into different modules.
All modules can be starred if found useful.
Monthly donations are split across users by stars earned that month.
Sasame uses the sasamtic algorithm (described below) to generate new modules.

This method:
Prevents wasted work
Reduces tunnel vision
Enables worldwide collaboration
Bridges work with education and incentivizes both
Helps people accomplish their dreams regardless of background or financial status
Uses Machine Learning to accelerate development
Promotes communication and diplomacy by aiming for novel solutions over simple compromise
Promotes the development of transparent systems
Is Scalable


## 2. United Life: A Non Profit for Connecting Humanity in Positive ways.

1) Supports the development/accessibility of Sasame and diversity of input 
2) Runs an annual global conference to promote positive work on Sasame
3) Secures donations/grants for Sasame and United Life
4) All Board Members are expected to support the above,
as well as help lead the development of modules in their areas of interest

Monthly board meetings are held to:
Discuss development of 1-4
Allocate the budget (Server costs, Compensation, 1-4)
Quorum is ¾ of the board.
A simple majority of quorum (50% +1 is required to allocate funds)
Board members may be added or removed by unanimous vote
By-Laws may be amended by unanimous vote

Board members should be chosen for commitment to the cause:
To create a More Connected World
To solve Humanity’s Greatest Challenges
To build Knowledge and Accessibility to it
To have Fun and make the world more Fun




## Technological Overview of Sasame:

(Both ‘Passages’ and ‘Chapters’ are considered modules)

Users
    * May donate to Sasame
    * Receive funds from the monthly pot of donations according to the number of stars achieved that month added from all their created passages and chapters. Chapters also receive additional stars from the passages they contain. 
    * Can create accounts or work anonymously. Stars earned by anonymous users go to the user ‘Sasame’
    * Can create passages, or create chapters that contain passages.
    * Can search for chapters by title, sorted by number of stars.
    * Can view passages pulled from chapters throughout the site in the Home Feed (The Stream), or via User Feeds, or by clicking on a specific chapter in the Table of Contents. Content in feeds is sorted by date.
    * Can view a ‘Help’ page that redirects to a chapter containing a presentation explaining Sasame
    * Can click a button that recombines passages/chapters marked highly useful (by stars) to create new passages/chapters. These passages/chapters belong to the user ‘Sasame’
    * Funds received by the user ‘Sasame’ at the end of the month are donations to the United Life Nonprofit.

Passages
    * Can contain text/code/markup
    * Can have files/images attached
    * Can be flagged for sensitive content
    * Can have additional properties selected from a default or custom list
    * Can have permissions set upon creation for who can edit/delete
    * Can contain sub-passages, but sub-passages can not contain additional sub-passages
    * May be starred if found useful
    * May be bookmarked (checked) for future use, adding to the ‘Queue’
    * Bookmarked passages in the Queue can be sorted, edited, and stitched together to make new chapters, and contain a reference to the original. Stars added to modified passages belong to both the new passage and the original.
    * Users can directly record audio and attach it to a passage
    * Users can directly draw on a canvas and attach it to a passage
    * Canvas drawings are added to an internal queue sorted by usage. Users can iterate over this queue to create drawings from previously created drawings. Users can also select a portion of a drawing to add it to this queue. Drawings in the queue can be rotated and scaled before adding to the main drawing.

Chapters
    * Have a title
    * Contain passages
    * Can have properties selected from a default or custom list
    * Can have permissions set upon creation for who can edit/delete
    * Can be flagged for sensitive content
    * May be starred if found useful
    * May be bookmarked (checked) for future use, adding all contained passages to the ‘queue’

## AI

Genetic algorithms are algorithms that work by recombinating existing modules to create new ones, and subjecting them to a fitness test that results in a gradual improvement of fitness, or the ability to pass the test. With Sasame, the fitness test is whether a module is starred, and the properties and content of that module is what is recombinated. 

However, this process is constrained by user activity, preventing the accidental production of malicious code without oversight. Because Sasame is Open Source and all data is shared, it provides the opportunity for the transparent and accessible development of Artificial Intelligence systems.

Sasame can be considered to be a General AI, because it consists of a constantly and arbitrarily expanding database, with the useful paths being pointed out via user activity.

The difference between the Sasamatic Algorithm that Sasame uses and Genetic Algorithms is that Genetic Algorithms typically eliminate unfit modules. The Sasamatic Algorithm retains data and finds a use for it later. It does this by occasionally ‘tossing up’ modules that lack stars and seeing if the community can now find a use for these modules in the current context of the system.

A key difference between Genetic Algorithms and Sasamatic Algorithms is that Sasamatic Algorithms are guaranteed to eventually find a Global Optimum (a solution) for any given problem. It is essentially a bruteforce method with the Time Complexity of a Genetic Algorithm, which depends on the fitness function, which in the case of Sasame is User Activity.



## Social Impact Overview of Sasame

The completed Social Network should effectively host a community where literally anything can be built collaboratively through the website, with work shared throughout the community. Default properties can be added to modules to accomplish all sorts of features, and users can also write code within modules that defines new properties for others to use in new modules.

The Social Network ensures credit is given where credit is due via monthly compensation and maintaining a record of where all modules originated and from which authors. Stolen work may be remedied by admins changing the authorship of a given module. 

Sasame will be an accessible network for all ages and backgrounds due to the aggressive content flagging system. Anyone can flag content and it will not show up in the Home feed or User feeds. Users must click on chapters with flagged content in order to view such content, and the chapter will indicate that it has flagged content before being selected. User settings can be tailored to make flagged content totally invisible, or to allow it within feeds.

Because anything that is built on Sasame can become a small part of something bigger, it is easy to produce educational content that utilizes real world examples, with different chapters being tailored to different backgrounds, perspectives, and educational needs. In the same way, this provides an opportunity for people to better understand unfamiliar people and subjects through tailored explanations. It also allows traditionally underrepresented voices to have a say in the development of technologies and policies that affect them.

United Life will host events, competitions, and an Annual Global Conference to promote positive and ambitious work being done on the Social Network. The Nonprofit will also work to ensure that no voices are left out of the process. It will do this by collaborating with various entities without restriction.

The end result is a service where people can immediately begin educating themselves and building things, while receiving compensation for doing so. The Website will be reproduced on App Stores, providing users with the additional option of using Sasame to manage their local files, and choose what gets contributed to public servers.
