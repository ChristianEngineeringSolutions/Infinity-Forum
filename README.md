## Never do anything twice

Sasame is a versatile, modular, and merit-based Modern Library for worldwide collaboration. 
                          

Sasame is fresh, open-source and always improving. Help out by adding, categorizing, and starring useful information. Sasame keeps track of who did what, so you can use little pieces of everyone's work in your own. Share what you want to share, and gain reputation and rewards everytime someone duplicates your work or finds it useful.
                          

Create an account to get the most out of Sasame; this allows you to star and duplicate useful passages for your own purposes.
                          

Sasame has both a traditional and a graphic user interface. Instead of books, the Library of Sasame has passages. These passages can be text, music, images, code, animations, etc. They can even modify Sasame itself. And they can all be sorted and resorted like the pieces of a puzzle to accomplish any task.
                          

Passages can be labeled with 'keys' to give them certain properties. You can read more about what keys do in the key reference, or learn by checking out the metadata of passages in Sasame. Keys are always being added, and can also be created via passages.
                          

Passages can also be grouped into Chapters, which can have their access controlled by the creator.
                          

Information is ranked by 'usefulness'. This centralizes the flow of information towards productivity and prevents echo-chambers. Users can find passages and chapters sorted according to their wants and needs and curated by users with high reputations.
                          

Sasame has an aggressive content flagging system that warns users without restricting access.


As Sasame grows, we will explore utilizing AI and Machine Learning to accelerate growth. However, the users control what information becomes prominent and highly utilized via the starring system.


Users can give only twice as many stars as they have. This helps prevent malicious or non-serious activity.


We can learn and create **anything**, and solve every problem if we all work together. Sasame keeps that process transparent, accessible, and meritocratic.
                          

Access to information is critical. Sasame will grow to increasingly utilize peer-to-peer networks, compression, and encryption to ensure that no one is left out. Sasame will also encourage the production of servers and devices to access the library and keep it accessible for all.


Let's make our dreams a reality!

## Some use Cases

### Science, Education, Engineering

In the future, Sasame can be used to ensure that every bit of scientific data is added to the pool, even if a useful place for it needs to be found later.

Data presentation and formatting can also be automated via modular templates. For example, diagrams can be reused by other scientists while still pointing to the original author and giving them credit.

Engineers can use Sasame to find and share pieces of code, designs, and descriptions.

Science and Engineering can also be merged with Education; educators can stitch together real work and combine it with educational modules. This allows students to have real-world context to their studies, as well as communication with the authors!

Educators can also compete for the best modules to explain a given topic, with students having choices for what works best for them.

Furthermore, social scientists can use their skillset to provide context and critique to scientific and political situations, as well as add passages that improve our understanding of each other.

### Government

Passages pertaining to real-world crises or important situations can be rapidly starred and rise to the top, causing people of various fields to create modules to help solve the problem.

Additionally, individuals can contribute modules that can be stitched together to form actual draft policies which can later be approved by officials. This keeps everyone a part of the process, and enables ideas from every corner.

### Business

Choose what information you want to share, but increase your reputation and rewards by sharing more often. Instead of falling victim to copyright infringement, allowing others to copy your work on Sasame still points the credit to you!

Furthermore, you can conveniently take advantage of work being done by open organizations, categorized by type and usefulness.

### Personal

You can use Sasame to keep track of all your thoughts and ideas, and stitch them together when you find a useful place for them. Take notes and share them, perhaps they can become a small part of someone else's larger project.

Study on Sasame, create on Sasame, debate on Sasame.


## And really the opportunities are limitless as Sasame continues to grow.

The passages users create can modify the experience on Sasame itself. The core code is also under active development. Stay tuned!
