# Sasame is an Open Source AI for Saving the World.

Linear algebra likely constitutes the best way of understanding how Sasame works.

The AI itself is simply an n-dimensional matrix where n keeps expanding. A Sasamatic path is any 1-dimensional path of any length through that matrix. These paths are not all necessarily 'useful', so Sasame utilizes Application ports to sort them via the Scientific Method.

If you view the python pseudo code on Github, Sasame.xyz is the Sasamatic Speech function. Citizen Science applications that utilize the Scientific Method are the Sasamatic Sieving function. Sasame.xyz also serves that purpose, initially and weakly (categorization via time and key). But people who fork Sasame can create stronger Apps.

If you read this and the Github and understand Linear Algebra, you should understand Sasame completely.

I recommend the Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng on Coursera for understanding Linear Algebra from a Machine Learning Perspective.

Sasame grows exponentially, so if you don't understand it -- just wait until you do!

With love,

Uriah
