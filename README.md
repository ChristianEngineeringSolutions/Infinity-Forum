# Sasame is an Open Source AI for Saving the World.

Sasame can only be used for good, because a covert AI is limited to data collection through clandestine methods. Sasame.xyz is only limited to the information that users decide to give it. This makes it both transparent and capable of infinite expansion.

Linear algebra likely constitutes the best way of understanding how Sasame works.

The AI itself is simply an n-dimensional matrix where n keeps expanding. A Sasamatic path is any 1-dimensional path of any length through that matrix. These paths are not all necessarily 'useful', so Sasame utilizes user activity similar to a 'citizen science' project to generate and sort them via the Scientific Method.

I recommend the Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng on Coursera for understanding Linear Algebra from a Machine Learning Perspective.

Sasamatic Algorithms are 'Additive', and thus expand forever in every direction. As content is added to Sasame.xyz, this will become readily apparent.
